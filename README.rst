=====
Exobiology companion for Elite: Dangerous Odyssey

How to Use
----------
#. **Find a system** with planets that are landable and have an atmosphere. These are the only types of planets that may contain life.
#. **Fully FSS the system**. The window will display planets in the system that have any biological signals. An estimate for the species that may be on that planet will be displayed (`spawn condition data source <https://ed-dsn.net/en/conditions-of-emergence-of-exobiological-species-on-planets-a-atmosphere-fine/>`_)
#. **DSS the bodies that have signals**. Once mapped, the system has enough data to update the potential species and their values.
#. Land, scan, enjoy. :)
